# Soil-Resistance-Transmitter
This project allows the sprinkler inhibitor project to use soil resistance along with other information.  Soil resistance is measured using an inexpensive soil resistance probe.
The data is received and transmitted by an ESP32. The transmitter is a LoRa "modem style" tranciever.  Included in this project is a prototype receiver.
The receiver sketch is not intened to be a usefull receiver.  It is a repository for the functions you would likely need for your application.  Below are two photos of the 
finished transmitter.  The power soirce and the stake are taken from a Harbor Freight solar powered outdoor light.  It is shown in the last picture. The curcuitboard from my
sprinkler controller project can be used for this project.  Only a few connections to the back of the board are needed.
