# Soil-Resistance-Transmitter
This project allows the sprinkler inhibitor project to use soil resistance along with other information.  Soil resistance is measured using an inexpensive soil resistance probe.
The data is received, scaled and transmitted by an ESP32. The transmitter is a LoRa "modem style" tranciever.  Included in this project is a prototype receiver.
The receiver sketch is not intened to be a usefult receiver.  It is a repository for the functions you would likely ned for your application.  Below are two photos of the 
finished transmitter.  The power soirce and the stake are taken from a Harbor Freight solar powered outdorr light.  It is shown in the last picture.
